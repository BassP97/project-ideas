# project-ideas

Random project ideas I have (that I may, or more likely, may not, do at some point)

- [ ] verified LLM training. Think llm.c, but in verus
  - Would probably need to run on the cpu, since verifying gpu code seems hard. OTOH, maybe I could just write specs for the un-verified the cuda/gpu bits?
